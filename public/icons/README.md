## Icon Guidelines

When creating or updating icons, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain brand consistency**: Use the NaijaHub green color (#32a852) as the primary color
2. **Keep it simple**: The icon should be recognizable at small sizes
3. **Include padding**: Leave about 10% padding around the edges
4. **Use PNG format**: Ensure transparency is preserved
5. **Optimize file size**: Compress images without losing quality

- 72x72
